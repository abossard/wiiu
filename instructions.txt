Instructions:

*note* If Windows defender interupts the unzipping of these files then turn of windows defender real-time protection
       and unzip again. The actual exploit payloads are thought to be viruses by windows defender. Or just add an exception inside of your anti virus

*note2* If you can't get any of the self hosting to work then try browsing this site on your wii u. Its the same site just online:
http://107.170.0.56/

1. Install XAMPP to a local PC on the same local network that the Wii U is on
   (xampp installer included in the "PC Software" folder)
2. Browse to c:\xampp\htdocs\
3. Create a folder called "wiibrew"
4. Copy everything INSIDE of folder "www" into the folder: c:\xampp\htdocs\wiibrew
   Folder should look like:	
   - c:\xampp\htdocs\wiibrew\cafiine\...
                            \dumpiine\...
                            \hbl\...
                            \kexploit\...
                            \res\...
                            index.html
                            menu.json
                            menu.json.txt
5. Copy everyting INSIDE of folder "SD Card" to the root of your SD card overwriting files when prompted.
   SD card should look like:
   - SD:\wiiu\apps\...
             \coverM\...
             \discM\...
             \games\... (put your loadiine ready games in here)
             \saves\...
6. Put SD card back in WiiU
7. Turn on Apache in XAMPP
8. Test website on local PC by opening a browser (Chrome or another) and go to:
   localhost/wiibrew
9. If you cannot see the webpage on your local PC then you may have a port issue with XAMPP. Post
   in gbatemp thread with issues. You must have the xampp page working before you can test on Wii U.
10. 10. Learn your local PC's IP address and use that in the next step.
11. Open your Wii U and open the browser. Click on settings in the upper right corner. Click "Reset Save Data". Now browse the webpage:
    http://192.168.0.67(replace with your computer IP)/wiibrew
    For example, on my Wii U I type this into the address:
    http://192.168.11.169/wiibrew
12. You can launch Homebrewbrew launcher or Loadiine. You should only need to click once.
13. If you want to launch any of the other Homebrew then you will need to run the #1 or #2 kexploit first (each app tells you which one to load first). 
14. Tap the browser button and go back to your page and then launch any of the apps listed below the kexploits.

*note* If you change the port number in xampp to make it work then you need to include that in the URL
example:
Changed port to "12345". The address I use in Wii U browser is:
http://192.168.11.169:12345/wiibrew

*note2* If you would like to make shortcuts to direct payloads then type this into your bookmark:
http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/(www folder name)/HBL/(payload file)

So in my examples above I would type this into my 5.5.1 Wii U to bookmark for HBL direct loading:
http://192.168.11.169:12345/wiibrew/hbl/index.php

Here are all the payload links:

Direct Homebrew Launcher:
hbl/index.php = 5.5.0 and 5.5.1 users
hbl/540hbl.mp4 = 5.4.0 users
hbl/payload532.html = 5.3.2 users

Direct Loadiine GX2 0.3 launcher:
loadiinegx2/index.php = 5.5.0 and 5.5.1 users
loadiinegx2/540loadiine.mp4 = 5.4.0 users
loadiinegx2/payload532.html = 5.3.2 users

Loadiine Ready Kexploit:
kexploit/loadindex.php = 5.5.0 and 5.5.1 users
kexploit/540kexploit10.mp4 = 5.4.0 users
kexploit/532kex10/payload532.html = 5.3.2 users

NON Loadiine Kexploit:
kexploit/nonindex.php = 5.5.0 and 5.5.1 users
kexploit/540kexploit31.mp4 = 5.4.0 users
kexploit/532kex31/payload532.html = 5.3.2 users

*note3*

If you want to trick your Wii U into loading the same page every time that you open the browser follow these steps:

1. Let's say I want to load the HBL direct launch every time that I open my 5.5.1 Wii U browser. First turn off your server. (or just turn off wifi)
2. Open the browser and type in the direct link for your exploit (in my case "http://192.168.11.169:12345/Wiibrew/HBL/index.php")
3. The page will fail (if you have your webserver off or ethernet disconnected or wifi turned off)
4. Press the Home button
5. Press Wii U Menu
6. Open Mii Maker and let it load.
7. Exit Mii Maker with the button in the bottom left

Now every time you open your browser it will go to that link immediatly. You can cancel this by following the same steps for a different link.
